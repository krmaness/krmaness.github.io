Hello! My name is **Kelly Baker**. I'm currently a student at North Carolina State University in the Applied Statistics & Data Management graduate certificate program. I work full time in research for an economic development organization and in my free time enjoy spending time with my family, friends, and pups; traveling; and completing DIY home improvement projects.
