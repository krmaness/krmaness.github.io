title: R vs. Other Data Software
---

Prior to taking ST 558, I had only ever used R in one other course several years ago. My previous use was limited to running various regression analyses, but from what I recall, R seemed very user-friendly -- particularly because it didn’t have any of the finicky semi-colon issues that I had experienced on *multiple* occasions with SAS.

SAS is what I’ve had the most experience with. I never thought that I would ever hear myself say (or rather see myself type) these words, but at this point, I think I’d have to say SAS is my favorite statistical analysis tool. I believe this is due to the fact that I have had more exposure to SAS than to R. I have suffered through tiny little code errors that take way longer than what seems reasonably necessary to identify and have struggled mightily with certain components of SAS (insert shoutout to “do loops” here), but ultimately, my familiarity with the software has created a certain amount of comfort – and “like” – for working with it. Because I’ve learned the ins and outs of how the tool operates, my mind is framed, by default, to think how SAS thinks when coding. Strangely, I find myself sort of missing the incessant semi-colons and run commands while working in R. 

So far, the R language doesn’t seem terribly difficult, but – like with all things new -- there’s definitely a learning curve. What I have enjoyed most about using R so far is the markdown language. It’s so handy to be able to include plain text comments alongside code and then be able to spit those out into the final product. 

I look forward to continuing to advance my knowledge of the R language and RStudio!
